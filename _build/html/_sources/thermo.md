# Thermodynamics

There are three problems in this section, which build on each other. 

In the first problem, you will try out different approaches to developing a simulation of a large number of interacting particles confined in a box. You will see that the particular method of implementation can hugely impact the time the simulation takes to run.

In the second problem, you will develop this simulation to represent a collection of particles which repel each other and the walls of the box. This is an 'unconventional' thermodynamic system relevant to dust in plasmas and colloids in liquids.

In the final problem, you will further develop this simulation by adding drag and Brownian motion effects on the macroparticles.
