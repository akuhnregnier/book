# # Problem 2 - Answers
# 
# **The Monty Hall Problem**
# 
# ### Problem statement (from the problem sheets) - canonical variation (a)
# 
# > In a game, you can pick one of three doors, labelled A, B and C. Behind one of
# the three doors lies a highly desirable prize, such as the solutions to next summerâ€™s
# exams. After you have chosen, but not opened, one door (e.g., door A) the person
# who is presenting the game opens one of the remaining two doors so as to reveal that
# there is no prize behind it (e.g., door C might be opened). Notice that the gameshow
# presenter knows that the door he opens has no prize behind it. At this point you can
# either stick with your original choice (door A) or switch to the door which remains
# closed (door B). At the end, all doors are opened, at which point you will only win if
# the prize is behind your chosen door. Should you stick with your choice or is it better
# to switch? Justify your answers.
