# Quantum Mechanics

There are three problems in this section.

The first problem looks at the time evolution of a wavefunction before and after measurement. The second problem investigates time independent perturbation theory, and you will look at higher order perturbations to the ground state energy and eigenfunction of a particle. The final problem entails animating the angular eigenstate of the simple harmonic oscillator.
