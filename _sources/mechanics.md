# Mechanics

The Mechanics problems are in two parts. Problems 1 and 2 focus on numerical investigation of a particle bound in a given potential, and of the drag force acting on a skydiver.

Problems 3 and 4 involve numerical solution of Keplerian orbits, and then application of this to study asteroid impacts with Earth.
