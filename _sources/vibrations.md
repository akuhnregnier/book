# Vibrations

There are three problems in this section.

In Problem 1, you will study the energy of a damped spring oscillator.

In Problem 2, you will apply the same techniques to study 2 pendula connected by a spring, and then further extend this to a system of N pendula.

Finally in Problem 3, you will solve and animate the oscillation of a plucked guitar string.
